## Gesture_Recog_DL
### Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
- Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
- Stop: Pause the movie

### Process followed
We have experimented with Conv3D , CNN + RNN & GRU + MobileNet architectures. 
So followed the process as below
- Data Generator 
- Data Pre-processing
- Model Architectures building
- Testing
